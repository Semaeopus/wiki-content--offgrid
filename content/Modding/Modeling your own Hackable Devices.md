## How to create a Screen for a Hackable Object
Blender is used for this tutorial. The Model for this Fuse Box is already finished, it requires a screen.
Step 1
Create a Plane.
Change the Scale of the plane to 16x9 (this will seem very big)
Step 2
Apply the Scale to the Plane.
Step 3
In Edit Mode; UV Unwrap the Plane.
Step 4
Apply a texture to the Plane to check the UV placement.
Step 5
Scale down the Plane and place it where you want the Screen to be.
You might need to adjust your geometry for the Plane to fit. Don't change the shape of the Plane as this will distort the UVs.
Step 6
Make sure that the Screen has a unique Material name. Then this is ready to export.
