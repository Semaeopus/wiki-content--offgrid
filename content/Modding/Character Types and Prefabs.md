## Characters
Adding characters to your level is important as this will allow you to add other important systems such as conversations which is one way to introduce story elements to your level.
To add characters to your level you must open up the mission script and locate the character table. It should look something like this:
#### MISSING FILE TODO

To add a character in the table you must include the following:
* name
* displayName
* internalName
* characterType
* prefab
You can also include some optional parameters:
* *headProps*
This would look like the following in code:
```
-- Character definitions:
	characters = {
		joe = {
			displayName = "Joe Harman",
			internalName = "Joe",
			characterType = "player",
			prefab = "player",
            headProps = {"F_Med_Glasses-01"},
			spawnpoint = "PlayerSpawn",
			voice = "Big_Guard",
		},
	},
```
**Note.**When the characterType is virtual you do not need to add a prefab or spawn-point.
### Character Types and Prefabs

### Voice
There are currently two voices, "Big_Guard" or "Huge_Guard". A table giving more information should go here when more voices are added.
### Custom LUTs and head props
This is a subject of it's own, to customise the look of your characters further you will want to read up on[Head props](Head props)and[Character Colours](Character Colours).
### Virtual characters
Once you have created your virtual characters in order to use them within conversations you will have to add them to a network that is shared with the player. By default the mission script includes a mobile network called "Semaeopus4G" to connect other characters to this network you must use the ConnectToNetwork function. For example:`Mission.ConnectToNetwork(mission.characters.terrance,mission.networks.Semaeopus4G.name,mission.networks.Semaeopus4G.userAccessKey)`
### Adding Guards
When creating guards you must add:
* Spawn points
* Patrol route
* Profile
* Agent
```
-- Guard definitions:
	characters = {
		guard01 = {
	             displayName = "Thomas Template",
	             internalName = "Thomas",
	             characterType = "enemy",
		     prefab = "bigGuard",
                     profile = "GuardTemplate.lua",
                     agent = "Guard.lua",
		     spawnpoint = "GuardSpawn",
                     patrolroute = {
                             points = {
                                      "PatrolPoint_0-001",
                                      "PatrolPoint_0-002",
                                       },
                                      cyclic = false,
                                      },
		         },
	            },
```
#### Spawn points
To create a spawn point:
* Create empty game object
* Add the mission object script to the empty game object
* Select type "Spawn"
Your inspector should look something like this:
#### Patrol route
To create a Patrol point:
* Create empty game object
* Add the Patrol point script to the empty game object
* Within the Patrol point script component section you can define the maximum and minimum time a guard spends at the particular point.
* Repeat this process for as many points as you require.
Your inspector should look something like this:
#### Profile
When creating a guard you can give each one a personal profile, which will effect how each guard communicates and behaves.
This is a basic template and structure you should use:
```
Character ={

    Motivation = 0.6,
    Sociability = 0.5,
    FavouriteColor = { 1, 0.5586207, 0, 1 },
    Background = {

		FirstName = "THOMAS",

		LastName = "TEMPLATE",

		Nickname = {
			"Tommy",
		},

		DerogetoryName = {
			"Noggin",
		},

		FavouriteSwear = {
			"gosh-darn",
		},

		FavouriteFood = {
			"slice of Wensleydale cheese",
		},

		FavouriteSnack = {
			"Babybell",
		},

		FavouriteDrink = {
			"coffee",
		},

		BestFriend = {
			"Tristan",
		},

		RecipientPetName = {
			"Sweetums",
		},

		SenderPetName = {
			"Hubby",
		},

		FavouriteExclamation = {
			"Golly",
		},

		RandomHashtag = {
		  "#ROFL",
		},

		Mood = {
	    "happy",
		},

		PastEvent = {
		 "ate",
		},

		FutureEvent = {
			 "eat",
		},
    },
},
```
