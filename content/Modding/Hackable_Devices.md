Hackable Objects are a core feature of Off Grid, they come in many shapes and sizes, including phones, cameras, refrigerators... the list is endless, anything can be turned into a hackable object. Mainly because one of the main features of the game is to hack into things!
Hackable devices are interacted with by using the SSH Connection app and the access, UI, and function of each hackable device can be very varied and easily modified by modders.
